# vMenu
vMenu is server sided menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support.

\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

# Download & Installation & Permissions

## Download

Click [here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases) to go to the releases page and download it.


--------

## Installation
1. Download the latest release [HERE](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases) (under "Assets", click vMenu-`{version}`.zip)
2. Extract the folder `vMenu` and place it inside your `/resources/` folder (THE FOLDER NAME IS CASE SENSITIVE, THE RESOURCE WILL BREAK IF YOU FAIL TO NAME IT CORRECTLY). If you did it correctly, you'll end up with the `__resource.lua` file being right here: `/resources/vMenu/__resource.lua`.
3. Next, copy the `permissions.cfg` file from `/resources/vMenu/config/permissions.cfg` to the same folder where your `server.cfg` file is located.
4. Then open your `server.cfg` file and add this to the very top of the file: `exec permissions.cfg`. If you're updating from an older version of vMenu (before v1.1.5) then make sure to add `add_ace resource.vMenu command.sets allow` to the bottom of your `permissions.cfg` file.
5. While still having the `server.cfg` file open, go to wherever you want your resources to start, and add `start vMenu` on a new line.
6. Restart the server and you should be able to use all basic functions. For more advanced configuration options, checkout the [configuration wiki page](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/wiki/Configuration). For info on how to setup the permissions, checkout the `PERMISSIONS.md` file inside the downloaded vMenu zip file, or checkout the [Permissions wiki page](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/wiki/Permissions).

## Zap Hosting
If you're using Zap Hosting, you may find that moving the `permissions.cfg` file to the same folder as your `server.cfg` file may not work correctly (it could get reset every time you restart your server).

If this is the case, leave your `permissions.cfg` file here: `/resources/vMenu/config/permissions.cfg` and add the following to the very top of your server.cfg file: `exec resources/vMenu/config/permissions.cfg` (instead of `exec permissions.cfg`).
